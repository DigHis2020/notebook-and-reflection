The data collection we are working with is vast. This provides a convenient and instant way to analyze and identify patterns, making sense of all the data. Through this, further research is spurred in the right direction. \n"

    "These graphs are based on the Ingenium open data collection. This is a catalogue of all artifacts from the Canada Agriculture and Food Museum, Canada Aviation and Space Museum, and the Canada Science and Technology Museum. It is available in CSV format so it was convenient to use in a Jupyter notebook. There were a few limitations in this collection. There were certain missing values that limited what topics could be explored. The descriptions of the artifacts were not uniform; a user would need to refine the information to be more consistent to make use of that information in a visualization. Otherwise this is a dataset with numerous and diverse columns to explore. "

From 1949 to 1968 Chapman was scientist  superintendent and deputy chief superintendent in the Defense Research Telecommunications Establishment in Ottawa and then assistant deputy minister for research in the federal Department of Communications. From 1958 to 1971 Chapman played a key role in initiating and directing the successful Alouette/IS scientific Earth satellite program. In 1966 he was appointed chairman of a government study group to examine the upper atmosphere and space programs in Canada. The resulting report was a landmark contribution to space policies and plans in Canada and led to the redirection of Canada's space program from scientific to applications satellites. Chapman was also the prime mover behind Canada's co-operative program with NASA and the European Space Agency to design  build and demonstrate the Hermes Communications Technology Satellite which would provide Canadians in remote areas with direct-to-home television by satellite. Chapman was a member of the Royal Society of Canada. He was also part of the National Research Council (NRC) Associate committee on Space Research  a council of the top Canadian space scientists. He also served on the International Union of Radio Science and the American Geophysical Union. In the1990's the headquarters of the Canadian Space Agency was renamed the John H. Chapman Space Centre to commemorate Chapman's accomplishments in the space industry. Since 2000  the Canadian Space Agency has awarded the John H. Chapman Award of Excellence to celebrate remarkable contributions to the advancement of the Canadian Space Program & a lifetime of achievement in space science and technology (Refs. 2-5).\",\"NaN\",\"THIS ILLUSTRATION WAS PART OF THE HORTICULTURAL RESEARCH PROGRAM AT THE CENTRAL EXPERIMENTAL FARM IN OTTAWA IN THE 1920S AND THE 1930S.\",\"NaN\",\"In October 1973  CRC and RCA agree to build a 12GHz field effect transistor amplifier for use on the transponder of Hermes  the first Direct Broadcast TV satellite in the world  launched in 1976.

Much of the Canadian research was concentrated on amorphous silicon based cells which promised to yield high conversion efficiencies however what was gained in conversion efficiency was lost because production was slow and specialised. Due to a number of production setbacks  material limitations  and the \\\"end\\\" of the oil crisis the federal government withdrew the bulk of its funding and many small manufacturers went out of business. Recently (2010)  there has been a renewed interest in solar energy from the federal government resulting in a third generation of solar cell materials. Manufactured from an organic polymer [poly(2 7-carbazole)]  these new cells are produced in a lightweight ribbon which can be mass produced  is flexible and can be applied to a number of different substrates. It is believed that these properties make the organic cell more versatile and useful to the both the industrial and consumer industries and will ensure a longer life than the second generation photovoltaic cells of the 1970s.\",\"Canada\\u00ac\\u00eds first fully functional flight impact simulator.

This collection reflects three aspects of the modern Canadian mining  crucial to the understanding of this sector: mobility of the workforce  ethnicity in the workforce  and globalization. The mining workforce has been highly mobile on both community and individual levels. Entire towns formed around mining operations and died or changed their character when the resources were exhausted. Mining professionals  especially in the field of mineral exploration  work in various often remote locations around the globe  and cover long distances in their daily work. The items donated to the Museum well represent the type of tools and technologies necessary to working outdoors  in remote locations  and a tropical climate.

Synthetic and natural corneas have been implanted into humans for years. It is now a routine surgery with a variety of techniques and materials. The corneas in this acquisition represent a new development in this history  the use of bio-engineered materials for making the corneas. This material derives from recombinant human collagen  which is shaped and \\\"forged\\\" into biosynthetic corneas for implantation into humans. The implants are more accurately called \\\"biomimetic\\\" because the resulting implants mimic cell growth and restoration of natural cornea without the risk of rejection.

It was built by Northern Telecom at its Trans-Canada plant in Montreal. Northern Telecom and its predecessor  Northern Electric  was for decades Canada\\u00ac\\u00eds largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment. Originally a subsidiary of the AT&T-owned Western Electric  for which it manufactured American-designed products for the Canadian market  Northern Electric became Canadian-owned in the 1950s and in the 1960s began to design and produce equipment to meet the distinctive needs of Canadian telecommunication companies. In the 1970s  through its new research subsidiary  Bell Northern Research  the company made a concerted shift from conventional analogue equipment into the emerging field of digital communications  becoming in the 1980s the first equipment supplier to provide a complete line of fully digital switching and transmission gear. During this decade the company moved aggressively into export markets  and opened manufacturing and R&D operations in several countries. The company\\u00ac\\u00eds sales soared during the internet boom of the 1990s  but a combination of poor financial decisions and a failure to maintain its technological edge led eventually to its bankruptcy in 2009. The original Bell Northern facilities were designed with cutting edge telecommunications research and development in mind with the first three buildings on the campus featuring laboratories  an extensive research library  and an anechoic chamber. The anechoic chamber was the focal point of the Bell Northern Research acoustics research examining both the technology and placement of speakers and microphones in telecommunication devices. The anechoic chamber group was organized under the Industrial Design and working together with design were responsible for the development of the acoustic properties of most products.

DY-4 Systems was founded in Ottawa in 1978 with about 50 staff and this was the first microcomputer that they designed and built. They had started making dumb terminals and graphics terminals. Like virtually every computer company of the day  they quickly adopted IC technology to make small  affordable computers for business and scientific work. DY-4 were using clusters of \\u00ac\\u00e6 of these machines for engineering when Andy Fraser joined the firm in 1982. At that time they had 95 employees growing to 300 now. In November 2000  DY-4 was bought by CMAC of Montreal  which was in turn bought in November 2001 by the French firm Celectron. Their primary products are now V-MOS cards used in military vehicles like tanks  torpedoes  etc. The successor version to this Orion came out in 1982 and was based on Motorola's 68000 chip rather than the Z80 chip used in this model. The flood of machines aimed at similar target markets in this period drove many companies out of business  or like DY-4 Systems  into different but related equipment. DY-4 now makes equipment for the military. When this machine was built  DY-4 was at Lady Ellen Place and had a staff of approximately 50. Carleton University had a large installation of DY-4 machines though the donor was not certain if it was this model or the successor model.\",\"Ketchum Co. was incorporated in 1928 and still exists in 2002.\",\"THE ST.

This collection reflects three aspects of the modern Canadian mining  crucial to the understanding of this sector: mobility of the workforce  ethnicity in the workforce  and globalization. The mining workforce has been highly mobile on both community and individual levels. Entire towns formed around mining operations and died or changed their character when the resources were exhausted. Mining professionals  especially in the field of mineral exploration  work in various often remote locations around the globe  and cover long distances in their daily work.

Synthetic and natural corneas have been implanted into humans for years. It is now a routine surgery with a variety of techniques and materials. The corneas in this acquisition represent a new development in this history  the use of bio-engineered materials for making the corneas. This material derives from recombinant human collagen  which is shaped and \\\"forged\\\" into biosynthetic corneas for implantation into humans. The implants are more accurately called \\\"biomimetic\\\" because the resulting implants mimic cell growth and restoration of natural cornea without the risk of rejection. The initial human trials were successful (reported in 2010  see references below)  but this technique is still in the prototype phase with more engineering being developed. This development also represents new trends in laboratory medicine - close partnerships between genome-based biotechnology industries  hospital research institutes and laboratories.\",\"MADE BY WELL KNOWN CANADIAN SOFTWARE DEVELOPER COREL SYSTEMS INC.

The static nature of the builders\\u00ac\\u00ed plates means that they tend to be more important for research and proper identification of locomotives because locomotive builders\\u00ac\\u00ed rosters are listed by serial number and not by customer roster number. However  the customer roster number is also used extensively by railway historians as a means of identification and in many cases number plates served as a promotional piece for the locomotive purchaser. Name plates are part of earlier versions of the builders\\u00ac\\u00ed plates where the name of the manufacturer was separated from the location of manufacture and the serial number of the locomotive. The name plates offered represent some of the early manufacturers of locomotives in North America.

The SVS was first put to the test during mission STS-52 in 1992 and its performance evaluated for future uses. During Chris Hadfield's 1995 STS-74 mission  the successor to the SVS  the Advanced Space Vision System (ASVS) was used with the Canadarm to connect the docking module to the Space Station MIR's Kristall module.

The DO had provided the official time for all of Canada from 1905. In 1961 it was decided that this clock would replace the DO as the official source of time but the DO continued to monitor the Earth's rotation until 1970. The gradual difference in time between CS 1 and the astronomical determined time was compared and resulted in the occasional addition of a leap second at the end of some years.

Synthetic and natural corneas have been implanted into humans for years. It is now a routine surgery with a variety of techniques and materials. The corneas in this acquisition represent a new development in this history  the use of bio-engineered materials for making the corneas. This material derives from recombinant human collagen  which is shaped and \\\"forged\\\" into biosynthetic corneas for implantation into humans. The implants are more accurately called \\\"biomimetic\\\" because the resulting implants mimic cell growth and restoration of natural cornea without the risk of rejection. The initial human trials were successful (reported in 2010  see references below)  but this technique is still in the prototype phase with more engineering being developed.

Relatively new in 1973  this new and cutting edge GaAs GET Amplifier technology was chosen for its benefits in areas of weight  efficiency  linearality  and reliability over the current tunnel-diode  travelling-wave  or transferred-electron amps available at the time. The FETA design team at CRC moved forward to develop two FET Amps  one of each from the only two manufacturers of FETs of the period. Series \\\"0\\\" used Fairchild GETs while series \\\"1\\\" used Plessey FETs. Four of each amplifier models were built (prototype  engineering  flight  and spare). Together with FETA 04-Fairchild (CSTM 1985.0408)  the acquisition of FETA 14-Plessey completes the FETA development used on Hermes. According to Douville  Hermes was used to define the transponder for the Anik-C series of satellites for Telesat Canada.

It was officially retired in 2010  after 45 years of service. Also known  in its early days  as the 3.75-inch gun  it had a 3.65-metre smooth\\u00ac\\u00a8bore brass barrel and a 95-mm bore. This device could fire fully feathered birds weighing up to 2 lb. (910 grams). The 3.75-inch gun was apparently built to conduct impact tests on the tailplane / tail assembly of the Vickers Viscount turboprop airliner  a type of aircraft operated by Trans-Canada Air Lines / Air Canada and numerous other airlines around the world. The reason behind this interest was the crash of a United Air Lines Viscount on Friday  November 23rd  1962. As it flew over Maryland at an altitude of 1 800 m  the airliner ran into a flock of migrating swans. One of the two birds that hit the airliner damaged the port / left horizontal stabiliser to such an extent that it quickly broke off. The crew lost control of the aircraft. The Viscount fell near Ellicott City  west of Baltimore. All 17 people on board died. This tragedy was instrumental in pushing through a requirement that the tailplane / tail assembly of airliners be able to resist the impact of an 8-lb. (3.6 kg) bird . In late 1971  the 3.75-inch gun came to the Structures and Materials Laboratory of the National Aeronautical Establishment (NAE)  an independent division of the NRC based in Ottawa  on Montreal Road  with facilities at Uplands  near Ottawa . It was at that point that it joined the much larger 10-inch gun [2013.0141]. In late 1971 or early 1972  the 3.75-inch gun was fitted with a new 3.65-metre stainless steel smoothbore barrel with an 89-mm bore. It was known from then on as the 3.5-in gun. The basic operating principle of the 3.5-inch gun differed slightly from that of the 3.75-in gun. As was the case in the past  a fully feathered bird was put in a container / barrel plug  or sabot  prior to firing. The barrel of the gun was also moved away from the compressed air reservoir so that the loaded sabot could be put inside the barrel. This time around  two thin circular diaphragms capable of resisting slightly more than half of the air pressure in the reservoir were inserted to create a step chamber  or breech. The reservoir was separated from the step chamber by the inner or no. 1 diaphragm while the outer or no. 2 diaphragm separated the step chamber from the sabot containing the bird. Both diaphragms were originally made of aluminium alloy but  as their bursting characteristics proved somewhat unreliable  the team looked for a substitute material. By the late summer of 1968  it had chosen Mylar Polyester. One to three sheets were used for each diaphragm. The double diaphragm firing mechanism made it possible to achieve consistent firing speeds test after test  a crucially important factor in testing and one that customers needed / demanded . With the pressure between the diaphragms adjusted to half the air pressure in the compressed air reservoir  all the operator had to do was press the firing button on the gun control panel [2013.0142]. A quick action valve let out the pressure between the diaphragms. The one separating the reservoir from the step chamber failed  followed very quickly by the other. The suddenly released air hit the loaded sabot and pushed it down the barrel. The sabot was caught at the muzzle of the barrel by a spring-operated sabot catcher informally known as the stripper to ensure that only the bird hit the target. An adjustable hydraulic shock absorber now took care of the gun\\u00ac\\u00eds recoil. The 3.5-inch gun was kept in a building at all times . The 3.5-inch gun also fired dummy 20-mm shells and 25-mm steel balls at military aircraft windshields in order to improve their design. The main threats here were presumably projectiles rather than birds. Toward the end of its career  the device fired fully feathered birds into running gas turbine engines and human-made hailstones at panels made of composite materials. By and large  these particular tests were conducted on behalf of foreign customers. The 3.5-inch gun also played a limited role in the development of the two modern flight impact simulators currently operated by the NRC\\u00ac\\u00eds Institute for Aerospace Research (IAR)  or NRC Aerospace.

This distinguishes them from devices that employ subtractive processes  where material is removed to essentially sculpt the finished product. In conventional manufacturing  subtractive processes are commonly associated with machine tools  many of which operate automatically from physical templates or digital instructions. Digitally controlled additive manufacturing may be said to have originated with the Jacquard loom  in which punched cards control the arrangement of threads into the final pattern. Moulding machines are a common example of an additive device that uses an analogue model (the pattern and mould) to control the fabrication process. In 3D printing the model is a digital \\u00ac\\u00ecblueprint\\u00ac\\u00ee produced using computer aided design (CAD) or animation modelling software. Three dimensional printers were first developed in the late 1970s. A number of techniques have been employed  including extrusion deposition  granular materials binding (laser sintering) and photopolymerization (stereolithography). Before the turn of the century  devices were large  expensive and lacking in versatility. Their use was largely confined to industry. In 1995 MIT graduate students Jim Bredt and Tim Anderson modified an inkjet printer to extrude a binding solution onto a bed of polymer powder  coining the term \\u00ac\\u00ec3D printing\\u00ac\\u00ee and winning a patent on their design. In 2005-2006 two open-source projects associated with universities were established that stimulated the spread of low-cost 3D printing into the do-it-yourself  or \\u00ac\\u00ecmaker \\u00ac\\u00ee market. Established at Cornell University  Fab@Home released its first device  using a multi-syringe deposition system  in 2006. The RepRap Project  founded by Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in 2005  aimed to produce a device that could \\u00ac\\u00ecprint\\u00ac\\u00ee most of its own components. One of the individuals involved with the RepRap project was Sebastien Bailard  a physicist living in Ottawa. To date  no further information has been found about him. Another Canadian connected to RepRap was Wade Bortz  who in November 2008 was the first person outside the Bath lab to replicate all the printable parts of a RepRap machine. RepRap printers generally employed thermoplastic extruders mounted on a computer-controlled Cartesian XYZ platform. This is the same technology used in the MakerBot Replicator. The Replicator is fed by spools of ABS or PLA (bio-plastic) having a filament diameter of 1.75 mm. It can be configured for one or two nozzles (which allows two-colour printing) and builds up objects in layers of .2-.3 mm at a speed of 40 mm/second. The maximum nozzle temperature is 230 C. The device is controlled through proprietary software  a video game-style control bad and an 80 character LCD screen. It can print from files input from an SD card or USB device. The MakerBot has a print volume of 5 litres  producing objects up to the size of a loaf of bread.\",\"ARTISTS WERE EMPLOYED TO ILLUSTRATE PLANTS BEING STUDIED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A RECORD OF TRUE COLOURS AND TECHNICAL DETAIL BEFORE THE TIME OF RELIABLE COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHY.\",\"NaN\",\"ARTISTS WERE EMPLOYED TO ILLUSTRATE PLANTS BEING STUDIED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A RECORD OF TRUE COLOUR AND TECHNICAL DETAIL BEFORE THE TIME OF RELIABLE COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHY\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"ARTISTS WERE EMPLOYED TO ILLUSTRATE PLANTS BEING STUDIED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A RECORD OF TRUE COLOUR AND TECHNICAL DETAIL BEFORE THE TIME OF RELIABLE COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHY\",\"NaN\",\"ARTISTS WERE EMPLOYED TO ILLUSTRATE PLANTS BEING STUDIED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A RECORD OF TRUE COLOUR AND TECHNICAL DETAIL BEFORE THE TIME OF RELIABLE COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHY\",\"THE RECEIVER USED TO PRODUCE THESE DATA WAS SIMILAR TO THE GROUND LEVEL INSTRUMENT USED AT OTTAWA (SEE 940005).

This distinguishes them from devices that employ subtractive processes  where material is removed to essentially sculpt the finished product. In conventional manufacturing  subtractive processes are commonly associated with machine tools  many of which operate automatically from physical templates or digital instructions. Digitally controlled additive manufacturing may be said to have originated with the Jacquard loom  in which punched cards control the arrangement of threads into the final pattern. Moulding machines are a common example of an additive device that uses an analogue model (the pattern and mould) to control the fabrication process. In 3D printing the model is a digital \\u00ac\\u00ecblueprint\\u00ac\\u00ee produced using computer aided design (CAD) or animation modelling software. Three dimensional printers were first developed in the late 1970s. A number of techniques have been employed  including extrusion deposition  granular materials binding (laser sintering) and photopolymerization (stereolithography). Before the turn of the century  devices were large  expensive and lacking in versatility. Their use was largely confined to industry. In 1995 MIT graduate students Jim Bredt and Tim Anderson modified an inkjet printer to extrude a binding solution onto a bed of polymer powder  coining the term \\u00ac\\u00ec3D printing\\u00ac\\u00ee and winning a patent on their design. In 2005-2006 two open-source projects associated with universities were established that stimulated the spread of low-cost 3D printing into the do-it-yourself  or \\u00ac\\u00ecmaker \\u00ac\\u00ee market. Established at Cornell University  Fab@Home released its first device  using a multi-syringe deposition system  in 2006. The RepRap Project  founded by Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in 2005  aimed to produce a device that could \\u00ac\\u00ecprint\\u00ac\\u00ee most of its own components. One of the individuals involved with the RepRap project was Sebastien Bailard  a physicist living in Ottawa. To date  no further information has been found about him. Another Canadian connected to RepRap was Wade Bortz  who in November 2008 was the first person outside the Bath lab to replicate all the printable parts of a RepRap machine. RepRap printers generally employed thermoplastic extruders mounted on a computer-controlled Cartesian XYZ platform. This is the same technology used in the MakerBot Replicator. The Replicator is fed by spools of ABS or PLA (bio-plastic) having a filament diameter of 1.75 mm. It can be configured for one or two nozzles (which allows two-colour printing) and builds up objects in layers of .2-.3 mm at a speed of 40 mm/second. The maximum nozzle temperature is 230 C. The device is controlled through proprietary software  a video game-style control bad and an 80 character LCD screen. It can print from files input from an SD card or USB device. The MakerBot has a print volume of 5 litres  producing objects up to the size of a loaf of bread.\",\"EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF HOME BUILT HORN TRANSMITTER OF THE 20'S SHOWING EXCELLENT CONSTRUCTIONS PRACTICE.\",\"NaN\",\"Taken from Acquisition proposal  reference #1: Apples  human epithelial and fibroblast cells  plastic petri dishes and epoxy are preserved Henrietta-Lacks (HeLa) human cells grown in 46 slices of decellularized McIntosh apples (Modulevski  Pelling).

ROCH ENABLED THE HULL TO LIFT OVER FORMING ICE PACKS.\",\"Three dimensional printers make objects through additive processes  whereby successive layers of material are laid down to produce the desired shape. This distinguishes them from devices that employ subtractive processes  where material is removed to essentially sculpt the finished product. In conventional manufacturing  subtractive processes are commonly associated with machine tools  many of which operate automatically from physical templates or digital instructions. Digitally controlled additive manufacturing may be said to have originated with the Jacquard loom  in which punched cards control the arrangement of threads into the final pattern. Moulding machines are a common example of an additive device that uses an analogue model (the pattern and mould) to control the fabrication process. In 3D printing the model is a digital \\u00ac\\u00ecblueprint\\u00ac\\u00ee produced using computer aided design (CAD) or animation modelling software. Three dimensional printers were first developed in the late 1970s. A number of techniques have been employed  including extrusion deposition  granular materials binding (laser sintering) and photopolymerization (stereolithography). Before the turn of the century  devices were large  expensive and lacking in versatility. Their use was largely confined to industry. In 1995 MIT graduate students Jim Bredt and Tim Anderson modified an inkjet printer to extrude a binding solution onto a bed of polymer powder  coining the term \\u00ac\\u00ec3D printing\\u00ac\\u00ee and winning a patent on their design. In 2005-2006 two open-source projects associated with universities were established that stimulated the spread of low-cost 3D printing into the do-it-yourself  or \\u00ac\\u00ecmaker \\u00ac\\u00ee market. Established at Cornell University  Fab@Home released its first device  using a multi-syringe deposition system  in 2006. The RepRap Project  founded by Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in 2005  aimed to produce a device that could \\u00ac\\u00ecprint\\u00ac\\u00ee most of its own components. One of the individuals involved with the RepRap project was Sebastien Bailard  a physicist living in Ottawa. To date  no further information has been found about him. Another Canadian connected to RepRap was Wade Bortz  who in November 2008 was the first person outside the Bath lab to replicate all the printable parts of a RepRap machine. RepRap printers generally employed thermoplastic extruders mounted on a computer-controlled Cartesian XYZ platform. This is the same technology used in the MakerBot Replicator. The Replicator is fed by spools of ABS or PLA (bio-plastic) having a filament diameter of 1.75 mm. It can be configured for one or two nozzles (which allows two-colour printing) and builds up objects in layers of .2-.3 mm at a speed of 40 mm/second. The maximum nozzle temperature is 230 C. The device is controlled through proprietary software  a video game-style control bad and an 80 character LCD screen. It can print from files input from an SD card or USB device. The MakerBot has a print volume of 5 litres  producing objects up to the size of a loaf of bread.\",\"NaN\",\"Taken from Acquisition proposal  reference #1: Apples  human epithelial and fibroblast cells  plastic petri dishes and epoxy are preserved Henrietta-Lacks (HeLa) human cells grown in 46 slices of decellularized McIntosh apples (Modulevski  Pelling).

Space is a difficult visual environment with few reference points and frequent periods of extremely dark or bright lighting conditions. Astronauts working in space find it difficult to gauge the distance and speed of objects such as satellites. The development of the Space Vision System (SVS)  a machine vision system for robotic devices such as the Canadarm  was undertaken to enhance human vision in the unfavourable viewing conditions of space. The SVS can provide information on the exact location  orientation and motion of a specified object. Dr. MacLean evaluated an experimental Space Vision System for use in the Space Shuttle and in the construction of Space Station Freedom. The Space Vision System uses a shuttle TV camera to monitor a pattern of target dots of known spacing arranged on an object to be tracked. As the object moves  the SVS computer measures the changing position of the dots  and provides a real time TV display of the location and orientation of the object. This displayed information helps an operator to guide the Canadarm or the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) when berthing or deploying satellites. For the CANEX-2 experiments  target dots were placed on the Canadian Assembly (CTA)  a small satellite carried in the Space Shuttle's cargo bay. During the flight  a mission specialist used the Canadarm to deploy the CTA and take it through a series of manoeuvres using the information displayed by the SVS  while Dr. MacLean evaluated SVS performance and investigated details that needed to be considered to design a production model of the system. Beyond its application as a computerized eye for the Space Shuttle  the Space Vision System will be used to help construct and maintain the Space Station. Other applications include guiding small  remotely operated space vehicles for satellite retrieval and servicing. On Earth  advances in machine vision could leads to improvements in the manufacturing of products  in auto plants for example  and to applications involving work in environments such as mines or nuclear reactors (Ref. 1).\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"EXAMPLE OF MULTI-PAIR COPPER CABLES AVAILABLE IN A WIDE VARIETY OF SIZES AND GAUGES AND USED THROUGHOUT THE CANADIAN TELEPHONE SYSTEM\",\"INSTRUMENT WAS DESIGNED IN 1961 BEFORE SCIENTISTS HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH REQUIREMENTS OF RESEARCH IN SPACE ENVIRONMENT.

THE CBRA USES THE MAGNETIC DIPOLE RESONANCE OF THE CAESIUM ATOM. Cesium clocks work because the outer electrons in a cesium atom are normally in one of two very stable energy levels. However  if a cloud of cesium atoms is heated to 350 K (about 77 C) and a magnetic field is applied  the electrons shift their energy state and if passed through a microwave cavity the atoms can be separated. The ones of with exactly the right energy are allowed to pass through the cavity and stimulates an oscillator where the activity is measured. The oscillator frequency counts off the precise number of cycles required to define a second. The accuracy of CS 1 was 1 second in about 3 000 years (Ref. 6).\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"ARTISTS WERE EMPLOYER TO ILLUSTRATE PLANTS BEING STUDIED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A RECORD OF TRUE COLOUR AND TECHNICAL DETAIL BEFORE THE TIME OF RELIABLE COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHY\",\"THE MULTITRACK WAS THE FIRST 'STUDIO' INSTRUMENT BUILT BY LE CAINE & WAS CONCERNED SOLELY WITH THE MANIPULATION OF SOUNDS ALREADY ON TAPE.

This distinguishes them from devices that employ subtractive processes  where material is removed to essentially sculpt the finished product. In conventional manufacturing  subtractive processes are commonly associated with machine tools  many of which operate automatically from physical templates or digital instructions. Digitally controlled additive manufacturing may be said to have originated with the Jacquard loom  in which punched cards control the arrangement of threads into the final pattern. Moulding machines are a common example of an additive device that uses an analogue model (the pattern and mould) to control the fabrication process. In 3D printing the model is a digital \\u00ac\\u00ecblueprint\\u00ac\\u00ee produced using computer aided design (CAD) or animation modelling software. Three dimensional printers were first developed in the late 1970s. A number of techniques have been employed  including extrusion deposition  granular materials binding (laser sintering) and photopolymerization (stereolithography). Before the turn of the century  devices were large  expensive and lacking in versatility. Their use was largely confined to industry. In 1995 MIT graduate students Jim Bredt and Tim Anderson modified an inkjet printer to extrude a binding solution onto a bed of polymer powder  coining the term \\u00ac\\u00ec3D printing\\u00ac\\u00ee and winning a patent on their design. In 2005-2006 two open-source projects associated with universities were established that stimulated the spread of low-cost 3D printing into the do-it-yourself  or \\u00ac\\u00ecmaker \\u00ac\\u00ee market. Established at Cornell University  Fab@Home released its first device  using a multi-syringe deposition system  in 2006. The RepRap Project  founded by Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in 2005  aimed to produce a device that could \\u00ac\\u00ecprint\\u00ac\\u00ee most of its own components. One of the individuals involved with the RepRap project was Sebastien Bailard  a physicist living in Ottawa. To date  no further information has been found about him. Another Canadian connected to RepRap was Wade Bortz  who in November 2008 was the first person outside the Bath lab to replicate all the printable parts of a RepRap machine. RepRap printers generally employed thermoplastic extruders mounted on a computer-controlled Cartesian XYZ platform. This is the same technology used in the MakerBot Replicator. The Replicator is fed by spools of ABS or PLA (bio-plastic) having a filament diameter of 1.75 mm. It can be configured for one or two nozzles (which allows two-colour printing) and builds up objects in layers of .2-.3 mm at a speed of 40 mm/second. The maximum nozzle temperature is 230 C. The device is controlled through proprietary software  a video game-style control bad and an 80 character LCD screen. It can print from files input from an SD card or USB device. The MakerBot has a print volume of 5 litres  producing objects up to the size of a loaf of bread.\",\"NaN\",\"ARTISTS WERE EMPLOYED TO ILLUSTRATE PLANTS BEING STUDIED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A RECORD OF

    "To conclude, we have uploaded a collection of data to our notebook and displayed the columns of data in a chart. We have also successfully created interactive visualizations of data. In the first graph, numerical data was presented in a scatter plot. In the second graph, time-series data was presented in a histogram. Both of these feature the HoverTool which allows the user to browse over specific points and extract deeper meanings from the graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "I highly encourage users to experiment with the HoverTool to create interactive experiences within their own visualizations. This is one of many examples of how people can explore and engage with history instead of passively observing it. I also encourage users to practise narrowing dataframes by specifying a few items within columns. This is a valuable way to focus your research. \n",
